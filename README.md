# the fundamentals of a good developer
## There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people. When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things "just work". The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible. "Good developers don't understand what they are doing, and good developers do," says Max Kanat-Alexander. A "good developer" is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers. Most of the programming failures happen because of a wrong mindset.
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Simplicity and consistency are two main factors that affect code maintenance. Don't keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it – Max Kanat-Alexander. How much do you want a change and how much effort will it take to make it happen? The equation is simple: D=V/E. Don't try to solve one big problem; divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
### Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn't needed. You can't predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements. Assumptions are one of the great killers of a software project. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not what you think will happen in the future. Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required.
-Don't spend your time on repetitive tasks; if you can automate them, do so.

`Developers who measure their software quality based on code lines are wasting their time. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.` When you add logging and error handling to your project, you should add logging in a very early stage. When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn't guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption.


>Everything takes longer than you think. The smaller the project, the harder it is to estimate how much time and effort it will take.
Don't depend on external technologies. But when you have to, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can. Documenting your software's architecture and every module and components is required to see the high-level picture of your software. Write a comment to explain "WHY", not "WHAT" the code is doing. Be open-minded.

---Don't be obsessive about one technology. Use the required technology to solve a specific problem. Know when to quit and know when to ask for help. Ask for help if you are not sure about the solutions or don't know how to implement them.
